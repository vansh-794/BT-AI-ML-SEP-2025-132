# 🚢 Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster  

This repository contains my solution to the **Titanic Classification Assignment** given by **Badkul Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**  

The Titanic dataset is one of the most popular beginner-friendly datasets in Data Science and Machine Learning. The main objective is to predict whether a passenger survived or not, based on features like age, sex, passenger class, family size, fare, and more.

## 📌 Assignment Overview  

- **Organization**: Badkul Technologies Pvt. Ltd.  
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)  
- **Objective**:  
  Build a classification pipeline that demonstrates the ability to clean data, perform feature engineering, train ML models, and evaluate results.  

This assignment was designed to help understand the **end-to-end workflow of a data science project**.

## 🎯 Goals  

1. Perform **data cleaning** and handle missing values.  
2. Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand patterns.  
3. Create meaningful **feature engineering** like `FamilySize` and extracting titles from names.  
4. Train and evaluate **classification models**:  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree Classifier  
5. Validate performance using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.  
6. (Optional) Generate a Kaggle-style submission file.
